# Implementation-of-K-Means-Clustering-for-Customer-Segmentation

## AIM:
To write a program to implement the K Means Clustering for Customer Segmentation.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner

## Algorithm
1. Start the program
2. Import the necessary python libraries
3. Read the dataset of Mall_Customers csv file
4. From sklearn libraary select the cluster and import KMeans Clustering
5. Find the sum of squared distance between each points and the centroid in a cluster using Elbow Method
6. Plot the graph x and y as Number of Clusters and wcss respectively
7. Using the matplotlib library draw the scatter plot for the given number of clusters (ie. here n_clusters = 5)
8. Stop the program

## Program:
```
/*

```

## Output:

## Result:
Thus the program to implement the K Means Clustering for Customer Segmentation is written and verified using python programming.
